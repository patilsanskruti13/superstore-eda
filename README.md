Exploratory Data Analysis on Superstore dataset
# 🛒 Superstore Sales Data - Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Superstore dataset to understand sales performance, profit distribution, customer segments, and regional trends. The goal is to derive business insights that can support data-driven decision making.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the structure and quality of the dataset
- Analyze sales and profitability across categories and regions
- Identify factors affecting profit margins
- Draw meaningful business insights from visualizations

##  Dataset Information
- **Dataset:** Sample Superstore dataset
- **Rows:** ~10,000+
- **Columns:** 13+
- **Contains:** Sales, Profit, Category, Discount, Region, Customer Segment, Ship Mode, etc.

## 🔍 EDA Steps Performed
1. Data Loading & Cleaning
2. Handling missing & duplicate values
3. Summary statistics (`describe()`)
4. Univariate Analysis (Category-level sales, segment distribution, etc.)
5. Bivariate Analysis (Sales vs Profit, Discount vs Profit, etc.)
6. Correlation Analysis with Heatmap
7. Visualization using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**

## 📊 Key Visualizations
- Sales by Category (Bar Chart)
- Sales Trend by Year (Line Plot)
- Profit Distribution by Category (Boxplot)
- Sales vs Profit (Scatter Plot)
- Correlation Heatmap

## 💡 Business Insights
- **Technology** category has the highest sales.
- **Furniture** sells well but does not always generate high profit.
- **High discounts generally reduce profit**, indicating discounting strategies need reconsideration.
- **West region** shows stronger sales performance compared to other regions.
- Corporate and Consumer segments drive the majority of the orders.
